Research the following extensions:
    * shmop
    * sysvmsg
    * sysvsem
    * sysvshm

Possibly implement react loop
Implement Symfony Process component?
Implement actual lightweight event dispatcher rather than rolling our own
React promise model for asynchronous handling? (Would require moving to a react loop)
